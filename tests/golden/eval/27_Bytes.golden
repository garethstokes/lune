=== Bytes Manipulation Example ===

Creating bytes from [72, 101, 108, 108, 111] (ASCII 'Hello')
Length: 5

Packing 305419896 (0x12345678) as 4 bytes big-endian
Bytes: [18, 52, 86, 120]
Unpacked back: 305419896

Packing 1000 as 2 bytes big-endian
Bytes: [3, 232]
Unpacked back: 1000

Concatenating 2-byte and 4-byte sequences
Total length: 6

Slicing bytes 2-6 (the 32-bit portion from header)
Slice length: 4

=== Wire Protocol Pattern ===
1. Read 1 byte for message type
2. Read 4 bytes, unpack as Int32 for length
3. Read (length - 4) bytes for payload
4. Decode payload based on message type

Done!
