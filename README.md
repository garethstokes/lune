# Lune v0.1 Starter Pack

This folder contains:

- `spec/`  : The Lune Language Report (v0.1)
- `prelude/`: Prelude module stubs used by the examples
- `examples/`: Golden Programs (feature-alignment suite)
- `core/`  : Lune Core IR draft specification

Notes:
- The Prelude includes placeholder `extern` definitions for primitives that
  the compiler/runtime must provide.
- The Golden Programs are intended to drive the feature set and typechecker behavior.
